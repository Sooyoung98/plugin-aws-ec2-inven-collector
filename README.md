## AWS Service Endpoint (in use)

 There is an endpoints used to collect AWS resources information.
AWS endpoint is a URL consisting of a region and a service code. 
<pre>
https://ec2.[region-code].amazonaws.com
https://autoscaling.[region-code].amazonaws.com
https://elbv2.[region-code].amazonaws.com
</pre>

We use a lots of endpoints because we collect information from many regions.  

### Region list

Below is the AWS region information.
The regions we collect are not all regions supported by AWS. Exactly, we target the regions results returned by [describe_regions()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ec2.html#EC2.Client.describe_regions) of AWS ec2 client.
